    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players

    console.log( players, team )

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
        // If you update an array it will always reference back to the original array
        team[3] = 'Lux'

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice()
    
    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat( players )

    // or use the new ES6 Spread | takes every item out of your itterable and place them in your array
    const team4 = [...players]
    team4[3] = 'heeee hawww'

    console.log( team4 )

    const team5 = Array.from( players )
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
        name: 'Eli Bol',
        age: 88
    }

    // and think we make a copy:
    // const captain = person
    // captain.number = 89

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    // object.assign => takes a blank object, overwrites other object, and adds new properties 
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age: 12 })
    console.log( cap2 )

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // const cap3 = {...person}
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
